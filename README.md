# blurts-breaches-diff

JSON diff of breaches

## Usage:

```sh
# Fetch the /hibp/breaches endpoint from monitor.firefox.com and display any
# breaches in the past 4 days (if any).
$ npx pdehaan/blurts-breaches-diff -4d
```

Pretty basic. Pointless, almost. But lets me easily see if there have been any recent breaches added to the site.
